# Learning Projects

This repository contains my beginner-level projects and practice scripts in both Bioinformatics and Machine Learning.

## ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics Scripts

- `sequence_identity.py`: Calculates sequence identity (percentage of similarity) between two sequences.
- `dna_to_protein.py`: Translates a DNA sequence into its corresponding protein sequence.
- `reverse_translation.py`:This script simulates the reverse translation of a protein sequence into complementary DNA (cDNA), while simultaneously optimizing the gene for efficient expression in a selected host organism. The gene optimization process includes codon adaptation and consideration of host-specific expression requirements, ensuring higher protein yield and functionality
- `auto_translate.py` :A smart translation function that automatically detects whether the input sequence is DNA or RNA, and translates it into the corresponding protein sequence. This script simplifies the translation process by eliminating the need for manual sequence-type identification

### ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. To run a script:

```bash
python script_name.py
